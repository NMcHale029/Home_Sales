### Overview
Home Sales data from <https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv> was read into a dataframe. A temporary view was created from that dataframe, which was used to run several queries.

The temporary table was cached and validated. The cached table was used to run the same query to test for runtime.

The table was also partiioned by date_built, and a temporary table was created for the parquet data. The common query was run using this table and tested for runtime.

Once all queries were run, the table was uncached and validated

### Results
- The original query was run in .526 seconds
- The cached query was run in .373 seconds
- The partitioned query was run in .527 seconds

### Analysis
Caching the temporary table improved the run time of the original query by running in about 71% of the time. If the data set was larger, or the query was more complex, this could save a lot of financial and time resources.

The partitioned query had a negligible difference in runtime from the original query. However, the data was partioned in a way that didn't reflect the query being run. Data was partitioned by date_built, and the test query did not need data split by date_built. This query may have been doing more work in the same amount of time as the original query.

It appears that chaching has a more than nominal affect on the resources needed to query data. Partitioning can improve performance, but it would depend on how data is partitioned, and the specific query being run.
